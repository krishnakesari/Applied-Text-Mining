# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

LDA is a topic model generates topics based on word frequency form a set of documents.
* Very helpful for finding reasonably accurate mixtures of topics within  a given document set

Documents combine multiple topics

1. How to identify Topic
What kind of documents we have in a collection ?
Topic - Subject/Theme of a discourse

Topics are represented as a word distribution 

* Semantic Similarity
* Documents belong to same topic
* How these words are distributed
* Probability of a word in topic

Two Topic Modelling Approaches:
1. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA)
2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Generative Models for Text:
How likely you will see a word in the document 
If finding Harry is 0.1 - means 1 in 10 words is harry 

Steps:
1. Importing Documents
2. Preprocessing - Tokenization, stop words, stemming
3. Document term matrix
4. LDA and assessing topic distribution
